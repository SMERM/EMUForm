Form for EMUFest submissions

If you are getting bored, feel free to help. [Here](./public/doc/TODO.md) is our [TODO list](./public/doc/TODO.md).

**PLEASE NOTE**: if you want to test mail send/receive in the `development`
environment, please install (and then run) `mailcatcher`, like so:

```sh
$ gem install mailcatcher
$ mailcatcher
```
then, as described in the `mailcatcher` documentation, you may check the
testing mail sent pointing your browser [here](http://localhost:1080).
